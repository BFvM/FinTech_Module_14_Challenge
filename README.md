# FinTech_Module_14_Challenge
Machine_Learning_Trading_Bot

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge we seek to improve an existing algorithmic trading system to increase the 'firmâ€™s' competitive advantage. Using an existing baseline trading algorithm and model we consider a range of variables to seek to improve the returns on the trading algorithm. We also apply a machine learning model to determine if the model can yield better returns.

Steps within the challenge are:
1. Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses macine learning to automate trade decisions
2. Adjust input parameters to optimise the algorithm
3. Train a machine learning model and compare it to the baseline model
4. Create an evaluation report

## Technologies
Pandas, Jupyter Lab, PyVizlot, SciKit Learn, Numpy 

## Project analysis and report
